        VendorDescription Model

        The VendorDescription model represents a detailed description of a vendor. Each 
        vendor description can have multiple translations.

        It is part of a many-to-many relationship with the Vendor model, allowing for 
        historical versioning of Vendor Descriptions for a particular vendor. A Vendor 
        is associated with a single active Vendor Description at a given time.

        A VendorDescription can be associated with multiple translations of its value.
